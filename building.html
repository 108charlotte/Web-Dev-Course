            <h1>Building Your Own Website</h1>
            <p>At this point, you have explored creating structure with HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity with Javascript. 
                If you ever need to go back to review any of these topics, you can navigate to their pages for a quick overview or check W3 schools for more in-depth coverage! 
                First, let's go back and look at <a href="https://plainvanillaweb.com/index.html" target="_blank">plainvanillaweb.com</a>. 
                If you inspect the webpage, is there anything you can recognize that we have gone over? Do you feel like you have a understanding of how it is structured? 
                Now, do the same for this webpage! Is there anything you do not yet understand? We will be spending the beginning of this session reviewing some of the fundamental topics we have covered. 
                Other questions to consider: Is there anything that we didn't talk about? Does your general understanding give you an idea of what is going on in those places, even though you never learned about that topic specifically? 
            </p>

            <h2>Webpages in the Wild</h2>
            <p>After you've looked over this webite and plainvanillaweb, here are a few other ideas to explore: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://demo.100jsprojects.com/dice-roll-simulator" target="_blank">Dice Roll Simulator</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://demo.100jsprojects.com/stopwatch" target="_blank">Rock Paper Scissors</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="caption">These pages come from demos of websites at <a href="https://www.100jsprojects.com/projects" target="_blank">100 JS projects</a>, so you can check out more there if you would like to! </p>

            <p class="challenge"><b>Today's Challenge:</b> like we did on the day we learned CSS, go to <a href="https://www.codechef.com/html-online-compiler" target="_blank">codechef's online compiler</a> and design a simple website! It can have things like your todo list, a list of hobbies, a navigation bar, etc. (whatever you want to include)! 
            Feel free to take inspiration from the code found on this website or code snippets at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> or <a href="https://plainvanillaweb.com/index.html" target="_blank">plainvanillaweb.com</a>, but be sure to adapt them to make them unique! If you want inspo, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a> has some really cool ideas!</p>
            
            <p>Congratulations on making it so far through this series! For our final session next Sunday, we will set up github accounts, learn how to create a simple website with codespaces, and then publish with github pages! Looking forward to seeing you there!!</p>
