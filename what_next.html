            <p>Now that you have a solid foundation in basic web development, I would recommend practicing with projects. Once you create a few websites, you may want to consider how you can level up your applications, and that's what frameworks are for! While there's certainly a time and place for good vanilla web dev, many modern websites use frameworks such as these to build their applications, and becoming familiar with them can help you create more advanced applications. Each has their own benefits and drawbacks for different scenarios, and I have only listed a few of my favorites, so this is by no means a comprehensive list. </p>
