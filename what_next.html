            <p>At the end of this series, I'll populate this page with resources I think will be useful to anyone looking to continue their web development journey or pursuing programming in general! If you're curious, it will probably include resources related to more advanced frameworks which build upon of some of the things we've learned, such as React or Astro :) Thank you for joining me in this course, and best of luck in your future programming endeavours! </p>
