/* navbar styling */
/* it can be a good idea to start with a tutorial and then change your code so that it
looks how you want it to rather than starting from scratch and trying to figure out 
annoying details with spacing or other issues you may run into. Here is the starter 
code that I used for this navbar: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp */

* {
    /* you'll often see several fonts listed; this is because the first one is the first 
    choice, but the following ones are fallbacks in case the browser can't display that font */
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    /* this line is so that the navbar doesn't look like it's floating even though it has no 
    margin! if you want to understand more about how the margin and padding properties work, 
    I would recommend checking out the "computed" tab (next to styles, where you can see the 
    CSS code, not the HTML tab) where you can see a helpful diagram for the different regions 
    of margin/padding, etc. */
    margin: 0px;

ul {
  list-style-type: none;

/* let's reapply normal spacing for the main tag so that it isn't smushed against the wall or navbar */

/* but now the content of main is smushed together! let's add some spacing to the tags below it */
