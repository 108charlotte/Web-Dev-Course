        The inspect menu allows you to to see the code which makes a website run.

        HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language", which may sound scary :(
        Luckily, learning HTML essentially consists of memorizing a few essential tags, 
        and maybe a few extras for fun :)-->

            <h1>Web Development through Inspect</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to web development through inspect! In this series, we will explore how webpages on the internet work by looking at the code for actual webpages using chrome's 'inspect' tool. 
                We will be looking at simple webpages on the internet, such as <a href="https://plainvanillaweb.com/index.html">plainvanillaweb.com</a>, along with this website designed for learning 
                web development using inspect. To get started, you can inspect this webpage (see video below on how to do this with a two-finger click or the menu) or click on intro.html and inspect that. 
            </p>
            <!--this is how you insert a video. you can define a width and/or height, and if you set controls to true then the video will display the typical video controls you might see on youtube or
            another video player platform, such as full-screen, pause and play, change playback speed, etc.-->
            <!--if you only set one of the width/height, the rest of the video will scale according to that value to keep the ratio between the two the same (your video will not stretch more horizontally
            or vertically, it will scale with aspect ratio remaining the same)-->
            <video width="500" controls>
                <!--you can define the video link inside of the video tag, which allows you to have multiple as fallbacks. 
                for example, if you have a .mov and a .mp4 version of your video, you may want to include both in case your
                website in case the browser displaying it doesn't support one of the video types-->
                <!--in this case, I only have one video, which is a .mov-->
                <!--you may notice that a lot of things are written here which aren't strictly "necessary", 
                meaning that the webpage could render just fine without them. the reason all of this is here
                is so that we can help browsers make decisions, for example rendering the video with the type 
                that they support without having to try each of them and see which works. -->
                <source src="assets/How_to_Inspect_a_Webpage.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                <!--this is a fallback, meaning that if the browser does not support any of the videos, it will display this text instead-->
                Your browser does not support this video. If you are looking to inspect a webpage, just two-finger click and click inspect, or click view -> developer -> inspect to open the inspect menu.
