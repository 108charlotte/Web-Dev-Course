        The inspect menu allows you to to see the code which makes a website run. 
        Right now, you are looking at the website's HTML code. 
        HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language", which may sound scary :(
        Luckily, learning HTML essentially consists of memorizing a few essential tags, 
        and maybe a few extras for fun :)-->
